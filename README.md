# Module1-Capstone-Project

"Mziki Tours App" is a web application that showcases music awards for best labels in a given year. A user can visit the website to identify which music label warn the award in a given year. Also, the app enlists the featured speakers for the program, therefore, making it easier for the user to relate with speeches from different speakers.

The present project is part of the Microverse curriculum Module 1 block 5 Capstone project. The main objective is putting hands on practice to build a web application using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, while using Behance design.
